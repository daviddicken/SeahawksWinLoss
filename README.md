## Description
Seahawks Win/Loss was the final project for my first computer science class. When you open the program you will be greeted with a message from Marshawn Lynch.  
Seahawks Win/Loss is written in Visual Basic and is a form that reads data from a file.  
We pre-populated that file with the scores of all the Seahawks games since signing Russell Wilson. That data is processed so that the Seahawks win %, win/loss record,  
average and total points for and points against stats can be displayed.
At the bottom of the form the user is able to add new game data and save it to the file. If an error is found for one of the games in the file the user can select that game and then has the option to modify or delete the game containing the error.
Another feature of this program is the Vs. section. On the right side of the form the user can select a team from the drop down menu and the stats of the Seahawks Vs. the selected team will be displayed.
